Welcome to Lucy, a high-fidelity game engine, capable of rendering high quality assets, with main emphasis on performance and in-game graphics.
Lucy has a very performant Vulkan renderer, that will eventually support GI (Ray Tracing) solutions, to improve the visual fidelity.
Lucy is being developed by me and is in an experimental state.

### How to build
It is very easy to build Lucy, since this repository already provides all the third-party software that she needs. To build Lucy for Windows 10/11, use the **"Generate.bat"** file, to generate the **Lucy.sln** solution file.

### About this project
As the author of this project, I am fascinated by game engines, or computer graphics for short. I think the main reason for this fascination lies in the difficulty of creating such a project. I've never planned this engine to be the next Unreal or Unity. It is simply my hobby project that I am the architect of. 

Lucy is technically the older brother of **OxyEngine** (https://github.com/AAstroPhysiCS/OxyEngine), which I made it with Java (OpenGL), as that was the language I felt most comfortable with. As years progressed, I turned to C++ (Vulkan), which allowed me to freely use my "powers :)" with no restriction. Additionally, C++ is a language that is more widely used than Java in terms of computer graphics. So, it was also a nice step forward for my career as well.
